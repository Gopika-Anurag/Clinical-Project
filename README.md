Component Documentation
This document provides an overview and technical details for the main React components in the ClinicPlus application suite.

1. PatientComponentPage
Overview
PatientComponentPage is a comprehensive, single-page application designed to serve as a patient-facing portal. It allows patients to view their health overview, manage appointments, view reports, and interact with their healthcare providers. The design is fully responsive, adapting to both desktop and mobile viewports.

Key Features
Unified Dashboard: Consolidates all patient-related information into a single, easy-to-navigate interface.

Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach ensures a seamless experience on any device, featuring a collapsible sidebar for smaller screens.

Modular Content: Uses a tab-based navigation system to switch between different sections like Overview, Appointments, Reports, and Messages.

Self-Contained Styling: All CSS is encapsulated within the component file, making it a portable, standalone module.

Packages & Dependencies
react: Core library for building the user interface.

State Management
The component manages its state using React hooks:

activePage (useState): A string that keeps track of the currently selected tab (e.g., 'Overview', 'Appointments') to render the correct content.

isSidebarOpen (useState): A boolean that controls the visibility of the sidebar navigation on mobile devices.

Component Breakdown
Sidebar: The main navigation panel on the left. It lists all available pages and highlights the active one. On mobile, it can be toggled.

Header: The top bar of the application. It contains the page title and the hamburger menu button for mobile.

Content Components (PatientDashboardContent, OverviewDashboardContent, etc.): Each of these components renders the specific content for a given page/tab. They are displayed dynamically based on the activePage state.

2. ClinicalDashboard
Overview
ClinicalDashboard is a multi-faceted dashboard designed for internal clinic staff. It provides different views and functionalities based on the user's role: Admin, Doctor, Office, or Reception. This component centralizes clinic operations, from patient management to scheduling and billing.

Key Features
Role-Based Access Control: The UI and available features dynamically change based on the selected role.

Tabbed Interface: Each role has its own set of relevant tabs, allowing for focused workflows (e.g., a Doctor sees "Today's Schedule" and "Patients," while an Admin sees "User Management" and "Analytics").

Comprehensive Toolset: Includes features for managing users, viewing schedules, handling insurance claims, generating reports, and registering new patients.

Data Visualization: Incorporates charts and graphs in the Admin overview to provide at-a-glance insights into clinic performance.

Packages & Dependencies
react: Core library for building the user interface.

Note: While the current implementation uses inline SVG and CSS for charts, a production version would likely integrate a dedicated charting library like recharts or chart.js.

State Management
role (useState): A string ('admin', 'doctor', etc.) that determines which dashboard and set of tabs to display.

activeView / activeTab (useState): A string that controls which tab's content is visible for the currently selected role.

isSidebarOpen (useState): A boolean for toggling the sidebar on mobile.

Component Breakdown
Role-Specific Dashboards (AdminDashboard, DoctorDashboard, etc.): High-level components that contain the tab navigation and content for each role.

Tab Content Components (UserManagementTab, InsuranceClaimsTab, etc.): Individual components that render the specific data and UI for each feature, such as data tables, forms, or charts.

3. SuperAdminDashboard
Overview
SuperAdminDashboard is a high-level platform management tool designed for two distinct website administration roles: Super Admin and Admin. This dashboard is not for managing individual clinic operations but for overseeing the entire platform, its client clinics, and the website's content.

Key Features
Hierarchical Roles:

Super Admin: Has a complete system-wide view, including managing all clinics, platform billing, system settings, and all functionalities available to the Admin.

Admin: A platform manager with a more focused scope, such as overseeing a specific set of assigned clinics, managing support tickets, and handling website content.

Platform-Centric Modules: Features are geared towards SaaS management, including clinic onboarding, subscription billing, user management for clinic admins, and website content updates.

Data-Driven Dashboards: Both roles have unique dashboard views with key performance indicators (KPIs), charts, and activity feeds relevant to their responsibilities.

Packages & Dependencies
react: Core library for building the user interface.

State Management
role (useState): A string ('superAdmin' or 'admin') that switches between the two platform management views.

activeView (useState): A string that determines which page or module is currently being displayed (e.g., 'Dashboard', 'Billing', 'Support Tickets').

isSidebarOpen (useState): A boolean for mobile navigation.

Component Breakdown
Dashboard Views (SuperAdminDashboardView, AdminDashboard): The main landing pages for each role, featuring KPI cards, charts, and activity lists.

Management Components (ClinicManagementView, SupportTicketsView, ContentManagementView, SuperAdminBilling): These components render the core features of the dashboard, typically displaying data in tables and providing management actions.

Helper Components (DataTable, StatCard, BarChart): Reusable UI components used to build the dashboard's interface, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
